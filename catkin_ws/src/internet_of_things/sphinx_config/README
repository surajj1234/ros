Basic things needed to get speech recognition engine
1. Language Model
2. Dictionary
3. Grammar - optional, to enforce structure and rules on language

Language Model & Dictionary
1. Create a file called corpus.txt. Add all the sentences you would like to detect.
2. Upload corpus.txt at http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html and generate dict and lm files.
   You can improve the accuracy of the dictionary by tweaking the syllables in the auto-generated words in the dictionary. Not necessary most of the time.

Grammar
Need to create a grammar file in JSGF fromat. Make sure that the words in the grammar are in the same case as those in the dictionary.
